# **Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction**  

This project focuses on identifying customer churn patterns using event-based data. The analysis involves practical implementation of exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and theoretical insights into predictive modeling, user retention strategies, and actionable recommendations.  

## **Project Overview**  
Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop engaging with a product or service, is a critical metric for businesses. By analyzing customer behavior and building predictive models, companies can proactively address churn and improve retention.  

### **Key Objectives**  
- Identify churn signals using exploratory data analysis.  
- Engineer meaningful user-level features to capture customer behavior.  
- Propose a theoretical framework for predictive modeling and retention strategies.  

## **Workflow Steps**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing and EDA**  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.  
- **Event Distributions:** Analyzing events (e.g., views, cart actions, purchases) over time.  
- **User-Level Summaries:** Aggregating data for individual users to understand their behavior.  

### **2. Feature Engineering**  
- **RFM Metrics:** Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each user.  
- **Session Metrics:** Session count, average session duration, and bounce rate.  
- **Behavioral Patterns:** View-to-cart ratio, cart-to-purchase ratio, and inactivity periods.  
- **Product/Brand Preferences:** Most viewed/purchased categories or brands.  

> **Note:** All steps up to and including feature engineering were performed practically in the Jupyter Notebook. The implementations include hands-on coding and validations of data transformations.

### **3. Modeling (Theoretical Framework)**  
Due to system limitations, the modeling steps have been outlined theoretically, including:  
- Training and evaluating models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization.  
- Analyzing model outputs using feature importance and interpretability tools like SHAP.  

### **4. Recommendations & Conclusions**  
- Strategies to integrate the churn model into retention workflows.  
- Personalized interventions based on user behavior patterns.  
- Suggestions for targeted campaigns and loyalty programs to reduce churn.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for implementation and exploration.  

## **Project Highlights**  
- Practical implementation for data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering.  
- Theoretical insights into modeling and retention strategies due to system constraints.
